  <summary>Adagio</summary>
  <p>Adagio is a term in classical ballet for slow, graceful movements performed at the barre to warm up, improve balance and control, and develop strength and flexibility. These exercises, including tendus, développés, and grand battements, focus on maintaining proper alignment, engaging core muscles, and building strength and control in the supporting leg. Dancers also work on improving flexibility in the working leg to enhance range of motion and extension, ultimately preparing them for more complex movements on stage.</p>

  <p>The sequence starts with a developpé to the front at a 90-degree angle, followed by a balançoire and an attitude pose balance. Next, the dancer transitions to a passe position and performs a portdebras. Then the dancer remains in the pose and extends the leg to the front and do rond to the  back, before transferring to an attitude pose and holding the balance until the end of the music.
  The term "andedane" indicates that the sequence should be repeated from the beginning. Overall, this dance sequence seems to require a high level of skill and precision in execution.</p>
