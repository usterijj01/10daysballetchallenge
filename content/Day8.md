# Adagio

Adagio is also a term used in classical ballet to describe a series of slow, graceful movements performed at the barre. In the context of the barre, adagio exercises are often used to warm up the body, improve balance and control, and develop strength and flexibility.

In an adagio exercise at the barre, dancers typically begin in first or fifth position and perform a series of slow, controlled movements such as tendus, développés, and grand battements. The focus is on maintaining proper alignment, engaging the core muscles, and moving with fluidity and grace.

One of the key goals of adagio exercises at the barre is to develop strength and control in the supporting leg, which is critical for maintaining balance and stability in more advanced ballet movements. Dancers may also focus on improving flexibility in the working leg, stretching and lengthening the muscles to improve range of motion and extension.

Overall, adagio exercises at the barre are an important part of classical ballet training, helping dancers to build the strength, control, and grace they need to perform more complex movements on stage.




## **Exercice**

The sequence starts with a developpé to the front at a 90-degree angle, followed by a balançoire and an attitude pose balance. Next, the dancer transitions to a passe position and performs a portdebras.

Then the dancer remains in the pose and extends the leg to the front and do rond to the  back, before transferring to an attitude pose and holding the balance until the end of the music.

The term "andedane" indicates that the sequence should be repeated from the beginning. Overall, this dance sequence seems to require a high level of skill and precision in execution.
