# Battement tendus

In classical ballet, a "battement tendu" (or simply "tendu") is a movement where the working foot slides along the floor until it reaches a fully pointed position, while the standing leg remains straight and firmly rooted into the ground. The term "tendu" comes from the French word meaning "stretched" or "tightened".

A battement tendu can be executed to the front, side, or back of the body, and it can be performed with a pointed foot, a flexed foot, or a demi-pointe position (where the foot is halfway between pointed and flexed). The movement can be slow and controlled or quick and sharp, and it is often used as a preparation for more complex steps, such as jumps or turns.

Battement tendu is one of the fundamental movements in ballet training, and it helps to develop the strength and flexibility of the legs, as well as the precision and coordination required for more advanced steps. It is often practiced in various combinations and sequences, both at the barre and in the center of the dance floor.



## **Exercice**

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:

The sequence begins with two battment tendu movements with the right leg forward, followed by two battment tendu movements with the left leg back.

Next, there are two battment tendu movements with a purlipie (unclear what this term means) to the side.

Then, there are two battment tendu movements forward with the right leg, followed by two with the left leg behind, similar to the beginning of the sequence.

Finally, the sequence ends with four battment tendus next to first position, followed by a demi plie and back pordebra.

The entire sequence is repeated again, with the term "andedane" likely indicating to repeat everything in the same order as before.

Overall, the text describes a relatively simple ballet warm-up sequence that involves various battment tendu movements, both forward and back, with some movements to the side and ending with a demi plie and poordebra attract. Understanding the full sequence would likely require more knowledge of ballet terminology and context.
