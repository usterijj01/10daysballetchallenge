  <summary>Battement tendus</summary>
  <p>In classical ballet, a "battement tendu" involves sliding the working foot along the floor until fully pointed, while the standing leg remains straight. It can be done to the front, side, or back with a pointed, flexed, or demi-pointe foot. This movement is often used as preparation for more complex steps, and it helps to develop strength, flexibility, precision, and coordination. Battement tendu is a fundamental movement in ballet and is practiced at both the barre and center of the dance floor.</p>

Then, there are two battement tendu movements forward with the right leg, followed by two with the left leg behind, similar to the beginning of the sequence. So there are a total of four battement tendu movements on each leg.</p>
