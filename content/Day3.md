# Battement tendus

In classical ballet, a "battement tendu" (or simply "tendu") is a movement where the working foot slides along the floor until it reaches a fully pointed position, while the standing leg remains straight and firmly rooted into the ground. The term "tendu" comes from the French word meaning "stretched" or "tightened".

A battement tendu can be executed to the front, side, or back of the body, and it can be performed with a pointed foot, a flexed foot, or a demi-pointe position (where the foot is halfway between pointed and flexed). The movement can be slow and controlled or quick and sharp, and it is often used as a preparation for more complex steps, such as jumps or turns.

Battement tendu is one of the fundamental movements in ballet training, and it helps to develop the strength and flexibility of the legs, as well as the precision and coordination required for more advanced steps. It is often practiced in various combinations and sequences, both at the barre and in the center of the dance floor.
