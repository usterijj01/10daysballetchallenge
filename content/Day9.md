# Grand battement at the barre

Adagio is also a term used in classical ballet to describe a series of slow, graceful movements performed at the barre. In the context of the barre, adagio exercises are often used to warm up the body, improve balance and control, and develop strength and flexibility.

In an adagio exercise at the barre, dancers typically begin in first or fifth position and perform a series of slow, controlled movements such as tendus, développés, and grand battements. The focus is on maintaining proper alignment, engaging the core muscles, and moving with fluidity and grace.

One of the key goals of adagio exercises at the barre is to develop strength and control in the supporting leg, which is critical for maintaining balance and stability in more advanced ballet movements. Dancers may also focus on improving flexibility in the working leg, stretching and lengthening the muscles to improve range of motion and extension.

Overall, adagio exercises at the barre are an important part of classical ballet training, helping dancers to build the strength, control, and grace they need to perform more complex movements on stage.




## **Exercise**

The text describes a series of grand battement movements in different directions, which involve lifting the leg high in the air with a straight knee.

The routine starts with two grand battements forward with the right leg, followed by a change to a passé position with the leg lifted behind. This is repeated with two grand battements back, followed by a change to a passé position with the leg lifted in front.

Next, the routine involves four grand battements with the left leg and two to the side with the right leg. Each movement involves a change from fifth position to a passé position, and then returning to fifth position on the back. The entire routine is repeated andedane.
