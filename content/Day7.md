# Battement frappe

Battement frappé is a classical ballet term that translates to "striking battement" or "beating battement" in English. This term refers to a quick, staccato movement of the foot in which the working foot strikes the floor in front or behind the supporting foot.

To execute a battement frappé, the dancer starts in a closed position with the feet together. The working foot is then placed on the floor next to the supporting foot, and the dancer quickly strikes the floor with the ball of the foot, pulling the heel back towards the ankle. The foot is then returned to the starting position, either in front of or behind the supporting foot, and the movement is repeated.

Battement frappé is often used as a preparatory exercise for other more complex movements, such as jumps and turns, and it helps to develop the dancer's speed, control, and coordination. It is commonly practiced at the barre during warm-up exercises, and it can be performed with or without music.
