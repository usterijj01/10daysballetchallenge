# Battement jete

Battement jeté is a classical ballet term that refers to a type of jump in which one leg is brushed into the air and then lands on the floor, while the other leg pushes off the floor to meet it in the air before coming back down to the ground. The term "battement" means "beating" or "to beat," and "jeté" means "thrown" or "thrown away."

To perform a battement jeté, a dancer starts in a preparatory position, such as fifth position, with one foot in front of the other. The dancer then brushes the front foot into the air while pushing off the back foot to jump. The front foot reaches its highest point in the air while the back foot meets it before both feet come back down to the floor in a closed position.

Battement jeté can be performed in a variety of directions, including to the front, side, and back, and can also be done en avant (forward), en arrière (backwards), and en tournant (turning). It is often used in classical ballet choreography as a showy and dynamic movement, and is a key element in many classical variations and solos.



## **Exercice**

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:

The sequence begins with two battment jete movements with the right leg in front, followed by three balensoirs (unclear what this term means) and a final point in the air behind the leg.

Next, there are two battment tendue jete movements with the right leg, followed by three balensoirs and a point in the air with the leg in front.

The sequence then includes two front-to-side pikes (unclear what this term means), followed by seven quick jets through the first position.

Finally, the text indicates that the entire sequence is to be repeated again, with the term "andedane" likely indicating to repeat everything in the same order as before.

Overall, the text describes a relatively complex ballet warm-up sequence that involves various battment jete and tendue movements, along with balensoirs, pikes, and quick jets. Understanding the full sequence would likely require more knowledge of ballet terminology and context.
