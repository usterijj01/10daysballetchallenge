# Battement jete

Battement jeté is a classical ballet term that refers to a type of jump in which one leg is brushed into the air and then lands on the floor, while the other leg pushes off the floor to meet it in the air before coming back down to the ground. The term "battement" means "beating" or "to beat," and "jeté" means "thrown" or "thrown away."

To perform a battement jeté, a dancer starts in a preparatory position, such as fifth position, with one foot in front of the other. The dancer then brushes the front foot into the air while pushing off the back foot to jump. The front foot reaches its highest point in the air while the back foot meets it before both feet come back down to the floor in a closed position.

Battement jeté can be performed in a variety of directions, including to the front, side, and back, and can also be done en avant (forward), en arrière (backwards), and en tournant (turning). It is often used in classical ballet choreography as a showy and dynamic movement, and is a key element in many classical variations and solos.
