# Rond de jambe

Rond de jambe is a fundamental movement in classical ballet that involves moving the leg in a circular motion. The term "rond de jambe" is French and translates to "round of the leg."

There are two types of rond de jambe: en l'air and à terre. En l'air means "in the air," and this variation involves lifting the working leg off the ground and moving it in a circular motion. À terre means "on the ground," and this variation involves keeping the working leg on the floor and moving it in a circular motion around the supporting leg.

In both variations, the circular motion of the leg can be done in different directions, including en dehors (outward) and en dedans (inward). Rond de jambe can be done in a variety of tempos and can also be performed with different port de bras (arm movements).

Rond de jambe is often used as a warm-up exercise in ballet class and is also incorporated into many ballet combinations and choreographies. It helps to improve flexibility, coordination, and control of the working leg, and it also develops strength in the supporting leg and core muscles.
