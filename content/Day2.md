# Demi plie

In classical ballet, a demi plié is a foundational movement that involves bending the knees while keeping the heels on the ground. The term "demi plié" is French for "half bend." It is usually performed at the beginning of a dance class or as a preparation for other steps in a ballet routine.

To perform a demi plié, follow these steps:

Begin standing in a turned-out position with your feet in first or fifth position. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed on both feet and your posture is tall and lifted.

Slowly bend your knees, keeping your heels on the ground and your back straight. Your thighs should be parallel to the floor, or as close to parallel as you can get without lifting your heels.

Keep your feet firmly planted on the ground and your weight centered over your feet. Make sure your knees are pointed out in the same direction as your toes.

Slowly rise back up to a standing position, pushing through your feet and straightening your legs.

Demi pliés can also be performed in different positions, such as second position or fourth position, depending on the ballet exercise or routine. It's important to remember to maintain proper alignment throughout the movement, engaging the core and keeping the upper body lifted and open.



## **Exercise**

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:

The sequence begins with two demi-plies (a half-bend of the knees) and one grand plie (a full bend of the knees) for the first second. It's unclear what "first second" refers to, but it may indicate a specific position or direction.

Next, there is a fourth grand plie, which is followed by a ronde de jambe (a circular movement of the leg) and a grand plie in fourth position (with one foot in front of the other).

Then, there is a grand plie in fifth position (with feet together), followed by another grand plie in fifth position, but only on one side ("andedane"). It's unclear what "andedane" means, but it could refer to a specific direction or placement of the foot.

The sequence concludes with a relevant balance, which likely means a balanced position held for a certain amount of time.

Overall, the text describes a short ballet sequence that includes a variety of movements, including demi-plies, grand plies, and ronde de jambes. It's difficult to understand the sequence fully without more context or knowledge of ballet terminology, but it appears to be a warm-up or exercise for dancers.
