# Demi plie

In classical ballet, a demi plié is a foundational movement that involves bending the knees while keeping the heels on the ground. The term "demi plié" is French for "half bend." It is usually performed at the beginning of a dance class or as a preparation for other steps in a ballet routine.

To perform a demi plié, follow these steps:

Begin standing in a turned-out position with your feet in first or fifth position. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed on both feet and your posture is tall and lifted.

Slowly bend your knees, keeping your heels on the ground and your back straight. Your thighs should be parallel to the floor, or as close to parallel as you can get without lifting your heels.

Keep your feet firmly planted on the ground and your weight centered over your feet. Make sure your knees are pointed out in the same direction as your toes.

Slowly rise back up to a standing position, pushing through your feet and straightening your legs.

Demi pliés can also be performed in different positions, such as second position or fourth position, depending on the ballet exercise or routine. It's important to remember to maintain proper alignment throughout the movement, engaging the core and keeping the upper body lifted and open.
