  <p>This is a short ballet sequence that includes demi-plies, grand plies, and ronde de jambes. The sequence begins with two demi-plies and one grand plie, followed by a fourth grand plie, a ronde de jambe, and a grand plie in fourth position. Then, there is a grand plie in fifth position, followed by another grand plie in fifth position on one side. The sequence ends with a balanced position held for a certain amount of time. It appears to be a warm-up or exercise for dancers.</p>
