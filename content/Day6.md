# Battement fondu

Battement fondu is a classical ballet term that refers to a movement where the supporting leg is bent and the working leg is extended, then the working leg is pointed and placed back on the ground. The word "fondu" means "melted" or "sinking" in French, and the movement is characterized by the smooth and controlled lowering of the working leg, as if melting into the floor.

To execute a battement fondu, a dancer begins in a standing position with their feet in first or fifth position. They then bend the supporting leg and extend the working leg, either to the front, side, or back, while maintaining turnout and proper alignment. The working leg may be pointed or flexed, depending on the desired effect, and the heel of the working foot may remain on the ground or rise slightly as the leg extends. Once the leg is fully extended, the dancer then points the foot and lowers it back to the ground with control, again maintaining turnout and alignment.

Battement fondu can be used as a preparatory movement for other steps, such as pirouettes, or as a decorative step in its own right. It can also be used to develop strength, balance, and control in the legs, as well as to improve turnout and alignment.
