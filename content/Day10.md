# Port de bras at the barre

Port de bras is a French term that means "carriage of the arms." It refers to the movement and positioning of the arms in ballet, which is an important aspect of the aesthetic and artistic expression of the dance. In classical ballet, the port de bras at the barre refers to the series of arm movements that are performed while holding onto the ballet barre for support.

During a typical barre warm-up in ballet, the port de bras exercises usually come after the pli√© exercises. The arms are moved through a sequence of positions, from low to high, and the head and torso may also be involved in the movement. The specific sequence of movements can vary depending on the ballet style and choreography, but some common positions include:

First position: The arms are rounded and held low in front of the body.

Second position: The arms are extended to the sides, with the palms facing down.

Third position: One arm is extended to the side, while the other arm is rounded in front of the body.

Fourth position: One arm is extended to the front, while the other arm is rounded behind the body.

Fifth position: Both arms are extended overhead, with the palms facing each other.

The goal of port de bras at the barre is to develop grace, fluidity, and control in the arm movements, which can then be incorporated into more complex movements and choreography in the center of the studio or on stage. It also helps to warm up the upper body and prepare the dancer for the more demanding movements that follow during a ballet class.
