  <p>Port de bras is a sequence of arm movements in ballet that involves moving the arms through various positions, from low to high, while holding onto the barre for support. It is performed during the barre warm-up after pli√© exercises and aims to develop grace, fluidity, and control in arm movements while preparing the dancer for more complex movements in the center or on stage. The positions of port de bras include first, second, third, fourth, and fifth positions.</p>
